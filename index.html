                            Hi, I'm Jiaxuan Ren, a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of 
                            Computational Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, I possess a strong problem solving initiative and analytical mindset.
                            <br><br>
                            I always expose myself to the latest technologies in my past work and project experience, and I am confident that my passion for continuous 
                            learning and team collaboration skills will be a great asset to industrial software and web development.

            <h2>Cage Game</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <div class="video">
                    <video src="test.mp4" style="width:700px;" controls="controls"></video>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I designed and developed the Cage Game using C++ and the EasyX Graphics Library. The game features a 2D graphical interface with interactive user 
                    guidance, allowing players to control character movement and collision detection. 
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure program stability, I implemented comprehensive unit tests 
                    with complete coverage and conducted load tests. Additionally, I focused on optimizing the pipeline efficiency, resulting in a remarkable 60% 
                    improvement. 
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, I enriched the gameplay experience by incorporating multimedia elements. The game utilizes a 2D array to represent the 
                    coordinates numerically, and a designated structure, POS, represents the position of the controlled character. An essential aspect of the game involves 
                    creating a control robot to detect the next position's coordinates, considering factors such as character pushing a cage or encountering destinations or 
                    floors upon user input. Through these efforts, I achieved an engaging and dynamic gaming experience for players.

                <p>
                    The Autocompletion System project is a command-line utility developed as an efficient word autocompletion feature using a trie data structure. 
                    It provides users with the ability to insert, delete, and query words for autocompletion. The core of the system is based on the trie data structure, 
                    which allows for the organization and storage of a dictionary of words.
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure accurate data handling, I utilized a recursive deep copy mechanism for the dictionary words. The system's performance and memory management were 
                    rigorously tested using Valgrind's soak tests, ensuring optimal efficiency. To enhance maintainability and security, I organized the codebase into 
                    separate module files. This project showcases my proficiency in algorithm design, memory management, and code organization, resulting in a reliable and
                     efficient word autocompletion system that offers a seamless user experience on Linux.

                     <br><br>
                     To enhance its online visibility, I implemented effective SEO techniques. Additionally, I designed and integrated a user registration and subscription
                      page with validation to ensure a smooth user experience. The website supports multilingual content through charset settings, ensuring compatibility 
                      across various browsers.

                   This a real-time Chrome extension group project using HTML and JavaScript with a focus on enhancing the colorblind user experience. The extension
                    provided users with customizable filters, enabling them to adjust and fine-tune specific colors according to their needs. 
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, the extension detected instances of insufficient color contrast and offered recommendations for color transformations to ensure better 
                    visibility for colorblind users. Regular updates were made to keep the extension compatible with the latest version of Chrome, ensuring 
                    a seamless user experience.
